# sn-surveyeditor
A component for creating and managing surveys without coding in SenseNet ECM. 


```diff
- Please keep in mind that it is a temporary repo for future improvement of Sense/Net Survey Editor. It doesn't work without Sense/Net ECM yet and cannot be installed over previous versions of Sense/Net ECM. By default it comes as a part of the enterprise version 6.5.4, so if you have this version of Sense/Net ECM you have Survey Editor already! 
```

We hope that in the near future it will have a standalone installable version without any `WebForms` dependency with backward compatibility and with a tons of new features, so keep your fingers crossed! :sparkles: :unicorn_face: :cat2:
